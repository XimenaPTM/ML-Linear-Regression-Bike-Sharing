A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.  BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demand
- Based on a variety of weather surveys and people's styles, the service provider has compiled a set of data on the daily demand for bicycles in the US market between 2018 and 2019.
