# General info

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.  BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demand
- Based on a variety of weather surveys and people's styles, the service provider has compiled a set of data on the daily demand for bicycles in the US market between 2018 and 2019.

# Methodology

For this project, I followed the following steps.

**1. Data understanding:**
The first step performed was to get to know and understand the data chosen for the Regression Problem with Python

**2. EDA:**
In a jupyter notebook, I implemented the EDA and an analysis of response and predictor variables.

**3. Data preparation:**
For the following step, I focus on preparing the data through coding and standardisation of variables. I separated the casual and registered columns to generate models for each type of user, as they behave differently.

**4. Modeling:**
Further, in this step, I develop differetn regression model to predict the number of bike registrations.

**5. Final observations:**
Finally, I compared the different models and select the best model between decision tree and random forest; by analyzing the Root Mean Square Error and the R2.
